    "text": "Data Display on Demographics\n\nRace\nWe are first presenting some data displays on some of the demographic variables in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first demographic variable we look at is race. Race is a nominal variable with 5 different categories: Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Asian non-Hispanic, and Other/Multiracial non-Hispanic. This table above shows the prevalence of autism within different racial subgroups. The data shows that the prevalence of autism does not vary much by race. All races show about around 3% of prevalence of autism, besides Asian subgroup, which is slightly lower (2.2%).\n\n\nSex\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second demographic variable we look at is sex. Sex is a nominal variable with two categories: male and female. Male has a three times higher prevalence of cancer (4.5%) comparing to female (1.3%).Thus, we are going to further investigate this variable.\n\n\nChildren’s Age\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third variable we look at the children’s age when diagnosed with autism. Age is an ordinal variable with categorized from 1 to 17 years. The graph above shows that start from 6 years old, the prevalence of autism rises to 3%.\n\n\nParents’ Age\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring previous literature review, we found out that parents’ age are associated with their children developing autism. Thus, the above graph looks at both parents’ age at the time the survey was taken. However, from our data, we don’t see a strong parents’ age differences between children with autism and without autism.\n\n\nParents’ education\n\n\n\n\n\nFor adult’s education variable, it is collected as the highest education of the household. The above graph shows no significant trend or relationship between the highest education level of parents and the prevalence of autism in their children.\n\n\nHousehold Income\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold poverty level is an ordinal variable with four categories: “400% federal poverty level or greater”, “200%-399% federal poverty level”, “100%-199% federal poverty level”, “0%-99% federal poverty level”. From the above graph, we can see that as household income decreases, the prevalence of autism of the children increases."

    "text": "More Data Displays\n\nMental Health Service Access and Sex\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now look at one of our predictor variables - Mental healthcare access status across sex. The above graph shows that for both sex, there is a significant higher prevalence of autism when children needed mental healthcare service but did not receive. However, for male, the overall prevalence is much higher than the prevlence in female. We propose sex to be a potential effect modifier in the association between mental healthcare access status and prevalence of autism among children.\n\n\nGenetic and Allergy\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph looks at another predictor variable that we are interested in- genetic status across allergy status. We don’t see much differences accross allergy status. However, for children with genetic disease, the prevalence of autism is much higher than those without genetic disease."
