    "text": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability in the human brain. Some people with ASD have a known cause, such as genetics, others cause still remain unknown. ASD begins before the age of 3 and would last throughout one’s life. According to CDC, 1 of 44 children has autism. Children with ASD may have difficulties developing and maintaining friendships, communicating with peers and adults, or understanding what behaviors are expected in school or on the job as they grow up (Control and Prevention 2022).

Race is a nominal variable with 5 different categories: Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Asian non-Hispanic, and Other/Multiracial non-Hispanic. This table above shows the prevalence of autism within different racial subgroups. The data shows that the prevalence of autism does not vary much by race. All races show about around 3% of prevalence of autism, besides Asian subgroup, which is slightly lower (2.2%).\n\n\nSex\n\nmy_table7 &lt;- data_recode %&gt;%\n  count(sex, autism) %&gt;%\n  group_by(sex) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent =round(n/sum(n)*100,1))\n\np7 &lt;- my_table7 %&gt;% \n        filter(autism == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n        ggplot() +\n          geom_bar(aes(x = sex, y = percent, fill = autism),stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") + \n          ggtitle('Sex') + \n          ylab('proportion') + \n          #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n          scale_fill_manual(\"autism\", values = c(\"Yes\" = \"mistyrose2\")) +\n          theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +\n          theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey\")) +\n          labs(y = \"Prevalence rate of Autism (%)\", x = \"Sex\", title = \"Prevalence of Autism\", subtitle = \"with regard to children's sex\", caption = \"Data source: 2019-2020 combined NSCH\") +\n          geom_text(aes(x = sex, y = percent, label = percent), size = 2.5, vjust = 1.8, color = \"lightsteelblue4\")\n          \np7\n\n\n\n\nThe second demographic variable we look at is sex. Sex is a nominal variable with two categories: male and female. Male has a three times higher prevalence of cancer (4.5%) comparing to female (1.3%).Thus, we are going to further investigate this variable.\n\n\nChildren’s Age\n\n#age \nmy_table8 &lt;- data_recode %&gt;%\n  count(age, autism) %&gt;%\n  group_by(age) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent =round(n/sum(n)*100,1)) %&gt;%\n  filter(autism == \"Yes\")\n\np8 &lt;- my_table8 %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= age, y= percent)) +\n  geom_segment( aes(x=age, xend=age, y=0, yend=percent), color = \"darkseagreen4\") +\n  geom_point( size=5, color=\"darkseagreen3\", fill=alpha(\"darkseagreen2\", 0.3), alpha=0.7, shape=21, stroke=2)+\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +\n  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey\")) +\n  labs(y = \"Prevalence rate of Autism (%)\", x = \"Age\", title = \"Prevalence of Autism\", subtitle = \"with regard to children's age\", caption = \"Data source: 2019-2020 combined NSCH\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = age, y = percent, label = percent), size = 2.5, vjust = -1.8, colour = \"lightsteelblue4\") +\n  ylim(0,4.5)\n\np8\n\n\n\n\nThe third variable we look at the children’s age when diagnosed with autism. Age is an ordinal variable with categorized from 1 to 17 years. The graph above shows that start from 6 years old, the prevalence of autism rises to 3%.\n\n\nParents’ Age\n\np4 &lt;- data_recode %&gt;% \n        select(autism, parent1age) %&gt;%\n        drop_na() %&gt;%\n        ggplot(aes(x = autism, y = parent1age)) +\n        geom_violin(trim = FALSE, fill = \"linen\", color = \"lightskyblue3\") + \n        labs(title = \"Prevalence of Autism\", subtitle = \"with regard to parent1's age\", x = \"Autism\", y = \"Age of Parent 1\", caption = \"Data source: 2019-2020 combined NSCH\") +\n        theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +\n        theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey\")) +\n        geom_boxplot(width=0.05, color = \"lightskyblue3\") \n\np5 &lt;- data_recode %&gt;% \n        select(autism, parent2age) %&gt;%\n        drop_na() %&gt;%\n        ggplot(aes(x = autism, y = parent2age)) +\n        geom_violin(trim = FALSE, fill = \"linen\", color = \"lightskyblue3\") + \n        labs(title = \"Prevalence of Autism\", subtitle = \"with regard to parent2's age\", x = \"Autism\", y = \"Age of parent 2\",caption = \"Data source: 2019-2020 combined NSCH\") +\n        theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +\n        theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey\")) +\n        geom_boxplot(width=0.05, color = \"lightskyblue4\")\nggarrange(p4, p5, ncol=2, nrow=1)\n\n\n\n\nDuring previous literature review, we found out that parents’ age are associated with their children developing autism. Thus, the above graph looks at both parents’ age at the time the survey was taken. However, from our data, we don’t see a strong parents’ age differences between children with autism and without autism.\n\n\nParents’ education\n\nmy_table9 &lt;- data_recode %&gt;%\n  count(adult_education, autism) %&gt;%\n  group_by(adult_education) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent =round(n/sum(n)*100,1))\n\np9 &lt;- my_table9 %&gt;% \n        filter(autism == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n        ggplot() +\n          geom_bar(aes(x = adult_education, y = percent, fill = autism),stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") + \n          ggtitle(\"Adults' Education\") + \n          ylab('proportion') + \n          #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n          scale_fill_manual(\"autism\", values = c(\"Yes\" = \"peachpuff2\")) +\n          theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +\n          theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey\")) +\n          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6)) +\n          labs(y = \"Prevalence rate of Autism (%)\", x = \"Adult's education\", title = \"Prevalence of Autism\", subtitle = \"with regard to Adult's highest education level\", caption = \"Data source: 2019-2020 combined NSCH\") +\n          geom_text(aes(x = adult_education, y = percent, label = percent), size = 2.5, vjust = 1.8, color = \"lightsteelblue4\")\n          \np9\n\n\n\n\nFor adult’s education variable, it is collected as the highest education of the household.

From the above graph, we can see that as household income decreases, the prevalence of autism of the children increases."

The above graph shows that for both sex, there is a significant higher prevalence of autism when children needed mental healthcare service but did not receive. However, for male, the overall prevalence is much higher than the prevlence in female. We propose sex to be a potential effect modifier in the association between mental healthcare access status and prevalence of autism among children.\n\n\nGenetic and Allergy\n\nmy_table6 &lt;- data_recode %&gt;%\n  count(genetic, allergy, autism) %&gt;%\n  group_by(genetic, allergy) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent =round(n/sum(n)*100,1))\n\np6 &lt;- my_table6 %&gt;%\n  drop_na() %&gt;%\n  filter(autism == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = genetic, y = percent, fill = autism), show.legend = FALSE, stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_wrap(~allergy) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"genetic\", values = c(\"Yes\" = \"pink\")) +\n  labs(y= \"Proportion of Autism (%)\",\n       x= \"Genetic Disease Status\",\n       title= \"Risk of Autism\",\n       subtitle= \"Comparing Genetic Status Across Allergy Status\",\n       caption = \"Data source: 2019-2020 combined NSCH\",\n       fill = \"Autism Status\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = genetic, y = percent, label = percent), size = 2.5) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +\n          theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey\"))\n\np6\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph looks at another predictor variable that we are interested in- genetic status across allergy status. We don’t see much differences across allergy status. However, for children with genetic disease, the prevalence of autism is much higher than those without genetic disease. This is also shown in current literature (Chua et al. 2021; Nemet et al. 2022)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe question we are interested in is what are some factors that are associated with autism in children aged 0-17 years. In this report, we first looked at data displays of some demographic variables. We found out that sex and household income level showed specific trends that we might want to further discover. Then, we looked at data displays of our predictor variables and outcome variables. Last, we conducted logistic regressions with all of the variables and found out that mental health service access, sex, insurance status, and genetics are the four variables that showed statistically significant results. We further performed two logistic regressions with interaction terms. The results showed that sex is an effect modifier of the association between mental health service access and prevalence of autism, and allergy is an effect modifier of the association between genetic disease status and prevalence of autism."
