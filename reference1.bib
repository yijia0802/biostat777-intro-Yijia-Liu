	abstract = {Abstract Background Previous studies reported controversial results regarding the association between allergic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD})/autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}). The aim of this article was to investigate whether allergic disorders are associated with {ADHD}/{ASD} in a large cohort of pediatric patients. Methods A retrospective study using the pediatric (0?18?year) database ({ICD}-9-{CM} codes) of Clalit Health Services during the years (2000?2018). Diagnosis of all disorders was made by specialist physicians. Results A total of 117?022 consecutive non-selective allergic children diagnosed with one or more allergic disorder (asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, skin, food, or drug allergy) and 116?968 non-allergic children were enrolled to our study. The mean follow-up period was 11?±?6?years. The presence of allergic disorders in early childhood (mean age of allergic diagnosis 4.5?±?4.3?years) in boys as well as in girls significantly increased the risk to develop {ADHD} (O.R 2.45, {CI} 2.39?2.51; p?{\textless}?.0001), {ASD} (O.R 1.17, {CI} 1.08?1.27; p?{\textless}?.0001), or both {ADHD}?+?{ASD} (O.R 1.5, {CI} 1.35?1.79; p?{\textless}?.0001). Children with more than one allergic comorbidity revealed a much higher risk. In a multivariable analysis (adjusted for age at study entry, number of yearly visits, and gender), the risk of allergic children to develop {ADHD} and {ADHD}?+?{ASD}, but not {ASD} alone, remained significantly higher. Conclusion Allergic disorder in early childhood significantly increased the risk to develop {ADHD}, and to a less extend {ASD}, in later life.},

	abstract = {Both allergic diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders are non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) that not only impact on the quality of life and but also result in substantial economic burden. Immune dysregulation and inflammation are typical hallmarks in both allergic and neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting converging pathophysiology. Epidemiological studies provided convincing evidence for the link between allergy and neurodevelopmental diseases such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) and autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}). Possible factors influencing the development of these disorders include maternal depression and anxiety, gestational diabetes mellitus, maternal allergic status, diet, exposure to environmental pollutants, microbiome dysbiosis, and sleep disturbances that occur early in life. Moreover, apart from inflammation, epigenetics, gene expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as possible underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these conditions. The exploration and understanding of these shared factors and possible mechanisms may enable us to elucidate the link in the comorbidity.},
